  <h1>Calicut</h1>
  
  <p>Kozhikode also known as Calicut, is a city in the state of Kerala in southern India on the Malabar coast. 
  Kozhikode is the largest urban area in the state and 195th largest urban area in the world. During 
  classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the “City of Spices” for its role as the
  major trading point of Eastern spices. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris(Zamorins) 
  in the Middle Ages and later the capital of the erstwhile Malabar district under British rule.</p>
