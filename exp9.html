<center><h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
 <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, located in Agra, India.
 This stunning mausoleum, built entirely out of white marble, is a symbol of love, 
 a testament to the devotion of Emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
 who passed away during childbirth in 1631. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653.
 Over 20,000 workers, craftsmen, and artisans from all over 
 India and Central Asia were employed to bring this architectural masterpiece to life.</p>
